# Creating your own Python library and hosting it on GitHub is a great way to share your work. Here's a step-by-step guide

## 1. **Set Up Your Library Structure**

Create a folder structure for your library. Example:

```bash
my_simple_library/
├── my_simple_library/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── simple_function.py
├── tests/
│   ├── test_simple_function.py
├── setup.py
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── .gitignore
```

- **`__init__.py`**: Makes the directory a package.
- **`simple_function.py`**: Your library's code goes here.
- **`tests/`**: Contains test scripts.
- **`setup.py`**: Defines the metadata for your library.
- **`README.md`**: Explains what your library does.
- **`LICENSE`**: Specifies the licensing terms.
- **`.gitignore`**: Lists files to ignore in Git.

---

### 2. **Write Your Code**

Example `my_simple_library/simple_function.py`:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my library."
```

---

### 3. **Create the `setup.py` File**

The `setup.py` file defines your library's metadata:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="my_simple_library",  # Unique name for your library
    version="0.1.0",  # Initial version
    author="Your Name",
    author_email="your_email@example.com",
    description="A simple Python library example",
    long_description=open("README.md").read(),
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/yourusername/my_simple_library",  # Replace with your GitHub URL
    packages=find_packages(),
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires=">=3.6",
)
```

---

### 4. **Initialize Git and Create a Repository**

- Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `my_simple_library`).
- Initialize a local Git repository:

  ```bash
  cd my_simple_library
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my_simple_library.git
  git push -u origin main
  ```

---

### 5. **Write Tests**

Create tests in the `tests/` folder. Example `tests/test_simple_function.py`:

```python
import unittest
from my_simple_library.simple_function import greet

class TestSimpleFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_greet(self):
        self.assertEqual(greet("Alice"), "Hello, Alice! Welcome to my library.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Run tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

---

### 6. **Publish to PyPI**

To make your library installable via `pip`:

1. Install the required tools:

   ```bash
   pip install setuptools wheel twine
   ```

2. Build your package:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

3. Upload to [PyPI](https://pypi.org):

   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

---

### 7. **Install and Test Your Library**

Once published, install it using:

```bash
pip install my_simple_library
```

The `__init__.py` file is used to define what should be accessible when someone imports your library. Here's how you can structure it based on your needs:

---

### **Basic Example**

If you just want to expose a simple function:

```python
from .simple_function import greet

__all__ = ["greet"]
```

Now, when someone imports your library:

```python
from my_simple_library import greet
```

They can directly access `greet`.

---

### **Advanced Example**

If you have multiple modules or functions and want to organize them better:

```python
from .simple_function import greet
from .other_module import another_function

__all__ = ["greet", "another_function"]
```

This ensures your library exposes only the functions or classes you explicitly define in `__all__`.

---

### **Empty `__init__.py`**

If you don’t need to do anything fancy, you can leave it empty, and Python will still recognize the directory as a package.

---

Would you like me to set up a complete example with multiple functions, or stick to a single one like `greet`?

Yes, you can install your library using `pip` without hosting it on PyPI by pointing to a local path or a GitHub repository. Here's how:

---

### **1. Install from a Local Path**

You can use `pip install` with a local folder or tarball:

#### **From a Local Folder**

If your library is in a folder (e.g., `my_simple_library/`):

```bash
pip install /path/to/my_simple_library
```

#### **From a Local Tarball**

1. Create a source distribution:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist
   ```

2. Install the `.tar.gz` file:

   ```bash
   pip install dist/my_simple_library-0.1.0.tar.gz
   ```

---

### **2. Install from GitHub**

You can push your library to a GitHub repository and install it directly from there.

#### **Steps:**

1. Push your project to GitHub (if not done already):

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Install from GitHub using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/my_simple_library.git
   ```

---

### **3. Use an Editable Installation (for Local Development)**

If you're actively developing your library, you can install it in "editable" mode:

1. Navigate to your library's root folder:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/my_simple_library
   ```

2. Install with `pip` in editable mode:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

Now, any changes you make to your library will immediately reflect without needing to reinstall.

---

Would you like guidance on setting up GitHub for the repository, or are you good to go?
If you got the message "Ran 0 tests" when running your test case, it usually means Python's test discovery did not find your test files or test functions. Let's troubleshoot and fix this:

---

### **Checklist to Fix the Issue**

1. **Ensure Test Files Are Named Correctly**
   By default, `unittest` discovers test files that match the pattern `test*.py` (e.g., `test_example.py`). Ensure your test file is named like this:
   - ✅ `test_simple_function.py`
   - ❌ `simple_function_test.py` (will not be discovered unless explicitly specified)

2. **Ensure Test Functions Are Named Correctly**
   Test function names must also start with `test_` for discovery.
   Example:

   ```python
   import unittest
   from my_simple_library.simple_function import greet

   class TestSimpleFunction(unittest.TestCase):
       def test_greet(self):  # Name must start with "test_"
           self.assertEqual(greet("Alice"), "Hello, Alice! Welcome to my library.")
   ```

3. **Correctly Run the Test Discovery**
   Use the following command to discover tests:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

   By default, this command:
   - Searches for test files matching `test*.py` in the current directory and subdirectories.
   - Looks for classes inheriting from `unittest.TestCase`.
   - Executes methods starting with `test_`.

4. **Check the Test Folder Structure**
   Ensure your project folder looks like this:

   ```bash
   my_simple_library/
   ├── my_simple_library/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── simple_function.py
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── test_simple_function.py
   ```

   - **Tip**: Add an empty `__init__.py` file in the `tests/` directory to make it a package (required for some setups).

5. **Explicitly Specify the Test Directory (Optional)**
   If your tests are in a specific directory (e.g., `tests/`), you can specify it:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

6. **Check for Import Errors**
   If your test file has import errors, it might silently fail. Ensure you’re importing correctly:

   ```python
   from my_simple_library.simple_function import greet
   ```

   If you run your tests from outside the project folder, use relative imports or adjust the `PYTHONPATH`:

   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest discover
   ```

---

### **Quick Test Run Check**

Try running the test script directly to verify it works:

```bash
python tests/test_simple_function.py
```

If it still doesn’t work, share your folder structure and the command you’re using to run the tests. I'll help debug further!
The error **`No module named 'greet'`** usually occurs because Python can't find the module or package you’re trying to import. Let’s fix it step by step:

---

### **1. Ensure Proper Import in the Test File**

If you're trying to import the `greet` function from `simple_function.py` inside your library, the import should look like this in your test file (`test_simple_function.py`):

```python
from my_simple_library.simple_function import greet
```

- **`my_simple_library`**: This is the package name (folder containing `__init__.py` and `simple_function.py`).
- **`simple_function`**: This is the module (file name).
- **`greet`**: This is the function.

---

### **2. Verify Your Folder Structure**

Your project should look like this:

```bash
my_simple_library/
├── my_simple_library/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── simple_function.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py  # Optional but recommended
│   ├── test_simple_function.py
```

- Make sure `my_simple_library/` has an `__init__.py` file. This makes it a package.

---

### **3. Adjust Your Working Directory**

When running tests, the Python working directory matters. You should run the command from the **root of your project** (the folder containing `my_simple_library/` and `tests/`).

#### Example

If you’re in the root directory:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

If you’re inside the `tests/` folder and try to run tests, Python might not find `my_simple_library`. Always run from the root.

---

### **4. Fix the Module Path**

If Python still cannot find `my_simple_library`, add it to the `PYTHONPATH`:

#### On Linux/Mac

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest discover
```

#### On Windows

```bash
set PYTHONPATH=.
python -m unittest discover
```

This tells Python to include the current directory in the module search path.

---

### **5. Test Directly**

To confirm your imports work, directly run your test file from the project root:

```bash
python tests/test_simple_function.py
```

If the import still fails, check the following:

1. The `simple_function.py` file contains your `greet` function.
2. The `my_simple_library` folder is at the correct location and contains `__init__.py`.

---

### **6. Example Fix**

Here’s a complete example:

#### **File: `my_simple_library/simple_function.py`**

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my library."
```

#### **File: `tests/test_simple_function.py`**

```python
import unittest
from my_simple_library.simple_function import greet

class TestSimpleFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_greet(self):
        self.assertEqual(greet("Alice"), "Hello, Alice! Welcome to my library.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

The error **`No module named 'greet'`** indicates that Python cannot locate the `greet` package because the `greet` directory is not being recognized as part of the Python module search path. Here’s how to fix it step by step:

---

### **1. Verify Folder Structure**

Ensure your project folder structure looks like this:

```bash
SDKs/
├── greet/
│   ├── greet/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── simple_function.py
│   ├── tests/
│   │   ├── __init__.py  # Optional but recommended
│   │   ├── test_simple_function.py
```

- The **outer `greet/`** is the project root.
- The **inner `greet/`** contains your library code (with `__init__.py`).
- The **`tests/`** folder contains your test files.

---

### **2. Correct the Import Statement**

In `test_simple_function.py`, use this import statement:

```python
from greet.simple_function import greet_name
```

---

### **3. Run Tests from the Project Root**

Navigate to the **outer `greet/`** directory (the project root) and run your tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

Python should now discover the `greet` package correctly.

---

### **4. Add the Project Root to PYTHONPATH**

If the above still doesn’t work, Python may not recognize the root folder. You can add it explicitly to the `PYTHONPATH`:

#### For Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell)

```bash
set PYTHONPATH=D:\AI-Engineer-Tech4biz\SDKs
python -m unittest discover
```

#### For Linux/Mac

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/SDKs python -m unittest discover
```

---

### **5. Editable Installation**

Another permanent solution is to install your library in **editable mode**:

1. From the project root, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Your library will now be available system-wide for import.

---

### **6. Verify Your Code**

If the issue persists, double-check your code:

#### **File: `greet/simple_function.py`**

```python
def greet_name(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the library."
```

**File: `tests/test_simple_function.py`**

```python
import unittest
from greet.simple_function import greet_name

class TestSimpleFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_greet_name(self):
        self.assertEqual(greet_name("Alice"), "Hello, Alice! Welcome to the library.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

---

### **7. Debugging**

If the problem persists, confirm:

1. You’re running commands from the correct directory.
2. The `__init__.py` files exist in `greet/` and `tests/` (they can be empty).
3. You’re not inside the `tests/` directory when running the tests.

The error indicates that your test case is failing because the actual output of the `greet_name` function does not match the expected output. Specifically, there are differences in the text, spacing, and punctuation.

---

### **Fix the `greet_name` Function**

The issue is likely in your `greet_name` function. Double-check its implementation in `greet/simple_function.py`.

Here's what it should look like based on your test expectation:

```python
def greet_name(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my library."
```

---

### **Compare the Outputs**

From the error:

- **Actual Output:** `Hello, Alice ! Welcome to the library !!!`
- **Expected Output:** `Hello, Alice! Welcome to my library.`

#### Differences

1. Extra spaces before `!` in `"Alice !"`.
2. Different message: `"Welcome to the library !!!"` vs. `"Welcome to my library."`.
3. Extra exclamation marks (`!!!`).

---

### **Steps to Fix**

1. **Update the Function Implementation**
   Ensure your function generates the expected output:

   ```python
   def greet_name(name: str) -> str:
       return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my library."
   ```

2. **Re-run the Tests**
   After fixing the function, run the tests again:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

---

### **If the Test Still Fails**

If the function is correct and the test still fails:

1. Double-check the test case in `tests/test_simple_function.py`:

   ```python
   import unittest
   from greet.simple_function import greet_name

   class TestSimpleFunction(unittest.TestCase):
       def test_greet_name(self):
           self.assertEqual(greet_name("Alice"), "Hello, Alice! Welcome to my library.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       unittest.main()
   ```

2. Verify you’ve saved the corrected function and test files.

---

### **Test Passed Example**

If everything is correct, you should see:

```plaintext
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK
```

The error **`UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte`** occurs because Python is trying to read the `README.md` file using the default encoding (`cp1252` on Windows), but the file likely contains non-ASCII characters that can't be interpreted by that encoding.

To fix this, you need to explicitly specify the file encoding when reading `README.md` in your `setup.py`.

---

### **How to Fix the `setup.py` File**

Locate the line in `setup.py` where `README.md` is being read and modify it to use UTF-8 encoding:

#### Current Code

```python
long_description = open("README.md").read()
```

#### Updated Code

```python
with open("README.md", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    long_description = f.read()
```

This ensures that `README.md` is read using UTF-8, which supports all Unicode characters.

---

### **Updated `setup.py` Example**

Here's what your `setup.py` file might look like after the fix:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="greet",
    version="0.1.0",
    author="Your Name",
    author_email="your_email@example.com",
    description="A simple library for greeting",
    long_description=open("README.md", encoding="utf-8").read(),
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/yourusername/greet",
    packages=find_packages(),
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires=">=3.6",
)
```

---

### **Steps to Fix the Installation**

1. Update your `setup.py` file with the change above.
2. Re-run the editable installation:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

---

### **Additional Notes**

- If you’re using `README.md` with non-ASCII characters, it’s always a good idea to use UTF-8 encoding.
- If the issue persists, ensure your `README.md` file is saved with UTF-8 encoding (most modern text editors like VSCode or Notepad++ allow you to check and set the encoding).

Let me know if the problem continues after applying this fix!
